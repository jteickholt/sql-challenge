# sql-challenge

## This repo contains the files used to create tabes in a PostgresSQL database as well as perform several queries from the database.  SQLAlchemy is also used in Python within a Jupyter notebook to query several of the tables and perform additonal analysis and create several visualisations.

### EmployeeSQL Folder:  This folder contains the SQL scripts and Jupyter notebook incuding:

#### 1.  ERD.png:  This is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database tables that were created.
#### 2.  queries.sql:  This script contains a series of SQL queries that access that tables that were created.
#### 3.  table-schemata.sql:  The script contains the sql code to create the tables within the PostgreSQL database. 
#### 4.  sql-alchemy.ipynb:  This is the jupyter notebook where I used sql-alchemy to pull data from the database create visualisations.
